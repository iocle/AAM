        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Academy for Aspiring Mathematicians (AAM) was founded with a single goal:
            to provide world-class math education accessible to students from all backgrounds.
            We believe that mathematical thinking is a superpower — one that opens doors to
            academic success, career opportunities, and problem-solving in everyday life.
